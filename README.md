---

VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating **expressive**, **long-form**, **multi-speaker** conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.

A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. VibeVoice employs a [next-token diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08635) framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.

The model can synthesize speech up to **90 minutes** long with up to **4 distinct speakers**, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

## Installation
We recommend to use NVIDIA Deep Learning Container to manage the CUDA environment. 

### 🔧 Setup Virtual Environment (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
Before installing dependencies, it's **highly recommended** to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Linux/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify activation (should show venv path)
which python
```

### 🐳 Docker Installation (Recommended)
1. Launch docker
```bash
# NVIDIA PyTorch Container 24.07 / 24.10 / 24.12 verified. 
# Later versions are also compatible.
sudo docker run --privileged --net=host --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 --ulimit stack=-1:-1 --gpus all --rm -it  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:24.07-py3

## If flash attention is not included in your docker environment, you need to install it manually
## Refer to https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention for installation instructions
# pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

2. Install from github
```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice.git
cd VibeVoice/

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (required for this application)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Install OpenAI (required for AI script generation)
pip install openai

# Install FlashAttention2 (optional, for better performance on CUDA)
# For Windows users, use pre-built wheels:
# pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# Or download from: https://github.com/sunsetcoder/flash-attention-windows

# Install the VibeVoice package
pip install -e .
```

### 💻 Direct Installation (Alternative)
If you prefer not to use Docker, you can install directly on your system:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice.git
cd VibeVoice/

# Install PyTorch with CUDA support (required for this application)
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Install OpenAI (required for AI script generation)
pip install openai

# Install FlashAttention2 (optional, for better performance on CUDA)
# For Windows users, use pre-built wheels:
# pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# Or download from: https://github.com/sunsetcoder/flash-attention-windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: Direct installation requires CUDA-compatible GPU drivers and PyTorch with CUDA support.

### 🔧 Device Compatibility & Fallback Support

VibeVoice now supports multiple device types with automatic fallback mechanisms:

- **CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs)**: Full support with FlashAttention2 for optimal performance
- **Apple Silicon (MPS)**: Native support for M1/M2/M3 Macs using Metal Performance Shaders
- **CPU**: Fallback support for systems without GPU acceleration
- **Windows**: Pre-built FlashAttention2 wheels available for easier installation

The application automatically detects your hardware and uses the best available attention implementation:
- `flash_attention_2` for CUDA (if available)
- `sdpa` (Scaled Dot Product Attention) for MPS and CPU fallback

## Usages

### 🚨 Tips
We observed users may encounter occasional instability when synthesizing Chinese speech. We recommend:

- Using English punctuation even for Chinese text, preferably only commas and periods.
- Using the 7B model variant, which is considerably more stable.

### Usage 1: Launch Gradio demo
```bash
apt update && apt install ffmpeg -y # for demo

# For 1.5B model
python demo/gradio_demo.py --model_path microsoft/VibeVoice-1.5B

# For 7B model
python demo/gradio_demo.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt
```

### Usage 2: Inference from files directly
```bash
# We provide some LLM generated example scripts under demo/text_examples/ for demo
# 1 speaker
python demo/inference_from_file.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt --txt_path demo/text_examples/1p_abs.txt --speaker_names Alice

# or more speakers
python demo/inference_from_file.py --model_path WestZhang/VibeVoice-Large-pt --txt_path demo/text_examples/2p_music.txt --speaker_names Alice Frank
```

## FAQ
#### Q1: Is this a pretrained model?
**A:** Yes, it's a pretrained model without any post-training or benchmark-specific optimizations. In a way, this makes VibeVoice very versatile and fun to use.

#### Q2: Randomly trigger Sounds / Music / BGM.
**A:** As you can see from our demo page, the background music or sounds are spontaneous. This means we can't directly control whether they are generated or not. The model is content-aware, and these sounds are triggered based on the input text and the chosen voice prompt.

Here are a few things we've noticed:
*   If the voice prompt you use contains background music, the generated speech is more likely to have it as well. (The 7B model is quite stable and effective at this—give it a try on the demo!)
*   If the voice prompt is clean (no BGM), but the input text includes introductory words or phrases like "Welcome to," "Hello," or "However," background music might still appear.
*   Spekaer voice related, using "Alice" results in random BGM than others.
*   In other scenarios, the 7B model is more stable and has a lower probability of generating unexpected background music.

In fact, we intentionally decided not to denoise our training data because we think it's an interesting feature for BGM to show up at just the right moment. You can think of it as a little easter egg we left for you.

#### Q3: Text normalization?
**A:** We don't perform any text normalization during training or inference. Our philosophy is that a large language model should be able to handle complex user inputs on its own. However, due to the nature of the training data, you might still run into some corner cases.

#### Q4: Singing Capability.
**A:** Our training data **doesn't contain any music data**. The ability to sing is an emergent capability of the model (which is why it might sound off-key, even on a famous song like 'See You Again'). (The 7B model is more likely to exhibit this than the 1.5B).

#### Q5: Some Chinese pronunciation errors.
**A:** The volume of Chinese data in our training set is significantly smaller than the English data. Additionally, certain special characters (e.g., Chinese quotation marks) may occasionally cause pronunciation issues.

## Risks and limitations

Potential for Deepfakes and Disinformation: High-quality synthetic speech can be misused to create convincing fake audio content for impersonation, fraud, or spreading disinformation. Users must ensure transcripts are reliable, check content accuracy, and avoid using generated content in misleading ways. Users are expected to use the generated content and to deploy the models in a lawful manner, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions. It is best practice to disclose the use of AI when sharing AI-generated content.

English and Chinese only: Transcripts in languages other than English or Chinese may result in unexpected audio outputs.

Non-Speech Audio: The model focuses solely on speech synthesis and does not handle background noise, music, or other sound effects.

Overlapping Speech: The current model does not explicitly model or generate overlapping speech segments in conversations.

We do not recommend using VibeVoice in commercial or real-world applications without further testing and development. This model is intended for research and development purposes only. Please use responsibly.
